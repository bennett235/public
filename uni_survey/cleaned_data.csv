I myself am a unicycle teacher in Leuven and for my thesis at school I did research into the best way to learn to unicycle. I also have additional questions such as 'does gender influence the learning process?' examined.

Maybe this is useful for you.

English,2021-06-25 07:07:25,en,54,2020,Canada,"I received 2 one-hour in-person lessons with a local high school age rider.  The lessons were very helpful even though some of the advice was bad (e.g., per what I had/have read online before and since and per my own personal experience since).  E.g., he advised me to look down just in front of the wheel while riding rather than to look up and much farther forward.

I learned to freemount and ride at the same time so my freemounts were getting pretty solid by the time I could ride 50 meters.  I think this is a great approach and would recommend it.  

I learned mostly on artificial turf (aka astroturf) soccer fields (and a little on grass fields) because they're softer to fall on compared to pavement.  On the one hand, this helped me to be more aggressive with my learning efforts, but on the other hand, the astroturf is soft and riding 50 meters on it turned out to be a lot more difficult than riding on pavement.  So I suspect I could have ridden 50 meters a little more quickly if I'd been riding on a hard surface (e.g., pavement or a gym floor would be ideal).  

I noticed several days where my learning advanced only after I'd already been practicing for 45 minutes, at a point where I was tired and would have expected my performance to be diminishing.  My instructor said he noticed the same when he was learning and advocated for minimum 1 hour practice sessions.  Most of my practice sessions were around 1 hour but some were as little as 30 minutes and a few as much as 1.5 hours.  

I found a few YouTube instructional videos very helpful.  In particular, the video “Tips on how to free mount a 24"" and a 36"" unicycle” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqWtEBgG300) really helped me understand that static free-mounting works best when you apply quite a lot of weight down through the saddle and handle.  That was extremely helpful for me.

These two Uniquest videos were also helpful for learning basic riding and freemounting:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWUoIv1ftXc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss8iPrDfTs0

I also read the book ""How to Ride Your Unicycle"" by Charlie Dancey.  I think this book was helpful and had a nice humorous tone.  I’d like to get his book on teaching unicycling, but I have not found it in stock on Unicycle.com so far.  

I kept careful track of my practice time and progress learning to unicycle (out of both idle curiosity and a habit of logging my fitness activities).
At 18 hours I static free-mounted and rode 50 meters for the first time. 
It wasn’t until 22 hours that I managed to do that again and was subsequently able to ride farther than 50 meters regularly.

A couple of the things motivating me to learn unicycle are: 
* desire to challenge and improve my balance (which I've noticed slowly deteriorating), 
* fitness (wow is unicycling great exercise!) 
* moving from impact sports (soccer, running) to lower-impact wheel sports (biking and unicycle). 

I've found learning unicycle similar to learning to play piano in some ways.  They seem to require development of neural pathways for balance (unicycle) and for, say, independent finger coordination (piano).  With repetition and time they develop...somewhat to my astonishment.  

Would you like the link to your survey broadcast to unicycle groups?  I'm happy to send it out to the local club.  

Bon courage !

Advice from my brother: just give it a try!
Lots of troubleshooting where only the bike fell over (as a beginner, don't hold on to the saddle!), Bit by bit the fine-tuning stability in the pelvis and trunk was added","3 years cycling without training wheels (at the age of 5 ""into the deep end"" by sister),
At least 5 years of kick scooter at high speeds, also around the curve,
2-3 years mountain hiking in the Alps,
1-2 years inline skates without being able to brake ...
Balancing on foot on railings","If I had known then:
For unicycle beginners, I recommend that the cranks are positioned horizontally after 'contacting' both pedals! NEVER try to drive off with one pedal down and one up - first load both pedals equally and stand upright, with only ONE hand on the wall / railing and sit down - while doing this, guide the saddle with your thighs so that it does not fall out, free arm as a balance bar. When pressure is applied to both pedals, you can alternate between releasing and increasing the pressure in your legs to move the bike while maintaining tension in your hips, back and stomach.
During the first 100 attempts, get used to letting the bike and saddle slam down so that you always land on your feet 😉

If at some point two free arms are no longer necessary for balance, one hand on the saddle handle can help with free ascents and jumps.

Requirements for the terrain:
Free ascent,
Commuting / driving backwards for overall control,
Jumping while standing AND while driving (long jump),
Driving over e.g. curbs without falling,
And the most important:
ACTIVE POSITION (saddle with buttocks in the back, sternum in front, cornering riding technique from the hips without arm rowing, balance by shifting the spine to the side instead of arm rowing),
After a while, a brake to be able to drive short cranks under 127mm downhill for a smoother step ...",M,3.0,20.0,125.0

I learned how to ride a unicycle with my siblings and my father in the driveway of our house with the help of garbage cans. We put the garbage cans together in a kind of alley so that we could hold on to the right and left and still sit upright on the unicycle. When we were able to drive the alley well, we shook hands or two and led each other through the driveway. Then we tried to drive a few meters from the garbage cans on our own ... In the kitchen in the house, a few first attempts were made from counter to counter ...","Before unicycling, I could roller-skate, ride a scooter, ski, and ride a bike.","Unfortunately, I can't really remember how long it took me to drive 50 m.

Interesting thing for sure. As a trainer, I have learned that the length of time it takes to learn to ride a unicycle varies greatly. And I think the motivation is the most important thing ... Do I want to ride a unicycle myself or do I have to learn to ride a unicycle because someone else wants to? Do I have like-minded people who want to train with me and have the same goal? Family friends ... can i copy it from someone? does someone teach me? Do I have the right unicycle for me? And of course: What kind of movement experience do I have? All of these circumstances have an enormous influence on the duration of learning. Nice study;).",F,201.0,20.0,127.0

I proppped the wheel on a curb, found the horizontal crank position to be most stable with weight on the back foot to start, and launched forward to gradually increase distance. I rode it everywhere for 2 weeks, then didn’t see a unicycle for 21 years after that.

I bought a new one this summer (24” Qu-ax entry-level model), and it took less than ten attempts (<20 minutes) to ride again with no distance limit (flat ground), then a total of ~10 hours over 2 weeks to re-tone my muscles for full stability. Recently I’ve tried practicing other skills using a wall, but that feels the least stable.","I was so bad at popular sports that everyone in the neighborhood hated seeing me at their games, and I was always in last place in gym class; I learned recently that it was because of a slight cognitive impairment where my mental processing and response time is slower than normal people, even though muscle memory is fine once I learn a skill.

Bicycling has been everyday transportation for 25 years (road bike, high speeds).

In university I trained in Aikido for 3 years.

My recent physical lifestyle has been sedentary (computer work), so unicycling was painful to start again at first, but the muscle memory was mostly intact.","I hope unicycling’s popularity skyrockets, and that several categories make it into the Olympics!

Most helpful mental image, from Learning To Unicycle:
Rotations – Now set yourself up in the power position and start with moving forwards in half-rotations of the wheel alongside your support (or while your support moves along with you). Initiate each half rotation by slightly leaning forward. For a brief moment keep the wheel stationary then pedal forward for a half rotation relatively quickly, so as to 'catch up' with your centre of gravity. Stopping in the power position between each half-
rotation will allow you to regain your balance and composure, and force you to practise putting pressure on the back pedal. When you feel ready, move onto full rotations at a time. While you’re doing this, remember to keep your upper body straight and upright and always keep the pressure on the seat.

I've had a few amblyopia muscle eye surgeries. Because of that history sometimes I have difficulty in three dimensional situations.
